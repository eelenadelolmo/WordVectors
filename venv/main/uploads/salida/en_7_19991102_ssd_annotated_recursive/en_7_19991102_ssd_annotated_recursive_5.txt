Three details certify that Spanish motorcycling was not barren, but only fallow: the presence, today, of a large group of very promising riders in the premier class of the 500cc, in addition to Crivillé (Gibernau, Checa, Borja, De Gea, Cardoso ...); the powerful financial contribution of sponsors (Repsol, Vía Digital, Movistar ...) who value the succulent advertising vein of motorcycling, and the organization, this year, of three great prizes (Catalunya, Valencia and Jerez), with a full house in the three circuits.
